This is a simple python script I wrote to convert Japanese audio into a transcript for studying the language. I've put it here on GitHub in case anyone else would like to use it.

Whisper can be resource intensive and take some time to process, especially on lower end computers.

### Setup
Install Python
Follow instructions here to set up Whisper - https://github.com/openai/whisper

### How to Use
1. Put audio files into 'in' folder.
2. (Optional) Set model in settings.json. You can open json files with a text editor.
3. Run RUN.bat
4. Check "out" folder for transcript
